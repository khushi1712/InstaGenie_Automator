# InstaGenie_Automator

This Python script automates various Instagram activities using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. It begins by logging into the user’s Instagram account securely and performs the following tasks:

- Searches for accounts related to topics like "food" and "Delhi."
- Automates following or unfollowing specific accounts like "Delhi."
- Looks up handles like "dilsefoodie" and interacts with their posts.
- Collects and displays followers of accounts such as "foodtalkindia" and "sodelhi."
- Checks which followers the user is following.
- Explores the "coding.ninjas" handle, checks for stories, and views them if available.

This project showcases the automation of Instagram tasks such as login, searching, following/unfollowing, and interacting with posts using Python’s Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries.
